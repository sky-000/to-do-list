# TO DO LIST
HELLO ðŸ‘‹ Viewers ,Welome to my profile.
This is a simple and clean To-Do List project I built to practice and improve my web development skills. It helps users stay organized by allowing them to add, delete, and manage daily tasks easily. Whether itâ€™s a reminder, a quick note, or your dayâ€™s plan, this tool keeps everything in one place.

ðŸ’¡ What I used:

HTML for structure

CSS for styling

JavaScript for functionality

Itâ€™s beginner-friendly and a great small project to understand how dynamic elements work on a webpage. Feel free to explore, clone, or suggest improvements!

This is project that I completed while developing my basic skills and combining them together to make a complete project
I made this while doing my summer internship from INFO ERA SOFTWARE SERVICES PRIVATE LTD.
